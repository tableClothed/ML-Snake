# Snake Game (with Gesture Recognition) üêç
A simple snake game. The snake's movement is based on the gesture read from your camera. Make sure to enable it, before the game!

Using:
- Pygame
- OpenCV
- Python 3.7
- Tensorflow
- icons from flaticon.com
- dataset containting 8000 images of hands



Trained on 4 different hand directions:
- Hand pointing up
- Hand pointing down
- Hand pointing left
- Hand pointing right


---------------
## THE RECOGNITION IS THE MOST ACCURATE IF YOU USE FOREFINGER AND MIDDLE FINGER OF YOUR RIGHT HAND

---------------

## Game rules:

Your aim is to score as many pints as you can, before the snake touches the red line or its own tail.

You gain points by 'eating' displayed on screen fruits. 

You are given 4 seconds to choose one sign among the ones listed above.

The snake will move in the gestured direction, or in case no sign was showed, it will keep moving in the previously selected direction.
